WIP

This is a Rework of the repository hellrhox.github.io.

The aim of this rework is to provide a project that can be dockerized and easly moved away from githubs pages feature if i want to.

-[X] Copy to new repo
-[X] Remove every non php backend used TypeScript/JavaScript file
- [X] Initial Commit for new repo
- [ ] Make a plan for reworking

This Repository should in this form still work as a simple php backend version.
(file reads offloaded to the server not the client, also more save-ish)
